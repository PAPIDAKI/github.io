### How to write good git commit messages

1.Seperate subject from body with a black line
2.Limit the subject to  50 chars max
3.Capitalize the subject line 
4.Do not end the subject with a period 
5.Wrap the body at 72 chars 
6.Use the body to explain what and why vs how 
7.Use the imperetive mood in the subject line

Imperetive mood means 'spoken or written as if giving a command or  instruction'.

Each of the seven rules are written in the imperative.
* Clean your room
* Close the door 


A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be
able to complete the following sentence:

* If applied,this commit will - your subject line here-

For exmple:
* If applied this commit will "Instruct how to write good commit messages"
* If applied this commit will "Build the index.html page"
* If applied this commit will "Write the user model "
* If apploed this commit wll "Write the model for the user"
* If applied this commit will "Write the view for the user"
* If applied this commit will "Calculate the sum total for the user model and view"




ie :
Summarize changes in around 50 chars or less

More detailed explanatory text if necessary.Wrap it to 72  
chars or so.

Explain the problem the commit is solving.
Focus on why you are making this change as opposed to how.
(the code explains that)
Are there any side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this?

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are ok.
